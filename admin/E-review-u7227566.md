Component: getFaces method in Dice

### Comments 

Code is well structured, easy to follow, good use of HashMaps.
Code is well documented with a good use of comments. 
All dice orientations are correct, except for 'k', which should be 3,5,6,2,1,4, and not
3,5,1,2,6,4. This can cause some errors in the viewer display and the game, including the heuristic.
Best feature about the code is it is well-structured, very intuitive to follow, and it
doesn't require much knowledge about HashMaps to understand the structure.
All types make sense, use of HashMaps makes the code a lot simpler.
Variable names and method names are sensible and easy to follow, and the style is consistent
