     * A state is well formed if it has the following format:
     * [variant][dice]*
     * where [variant] and [dice] are replaced by the corresponding substrings below. Note that [dice]* means zero or
     * more repetitions of the [dice] substring.
     *
     * 1. [variant] The variant substring is a single character which is either an upper or lower case 'p' or 'c' - The
     * letter encodes which variant the of the rules the game is using and the case represents the turn of the current
     * player.
     *
     * 2. [dice] The dice substring contains three characters. The first character can be either an upper or lower case
     * letter in the range 'a' to 'x'. The letter encodes the orientation of the dice and the case encodes which player
     * the dice belongs two. The next two characters encode the position of the dice in the format [column][row] where
     * the column is one character in the range 'a' to 'g' and the row is one character in the range '1' to '7'.
     *
     * See the "Encoding Game State" section in the README for more details.
